  - Commit hash (first 8 characters)
  - Status (normal/locked)
- Manual refresh support

### 2. Double-Click to Open Worktree
- Double-click any table row to open the corresponding worktree directory in IDEA
- Smart detection: if the project is already open, automatically switches to the corresponding window

- **Branch Selection Dialog**:
  - Displays all available branches
  - Real-time search filtering (case-insensitive)
  - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys)
  - Double-click for quick selection
  - Defaults to current branch
  - Supports entering new branch names
- Path Input Dialog:
  - Auto-suggests default path (project directory sibling + branch name)
  - Supports custom paths
- Auto-refresh list after creation

### 4. Delete Worktree
- **Two deletion methods**:
  - "Delete Worktree" button in the toolbar
  - Right-click context menu "Delete Worktree" option
- Confirmation dialog before deletion

### Viewing Worktree List
1. Open the Version Control tool window (Alt+9 or View → Tool Windows → Version Control)
2. Switch to the "Worktree" tab
3. View detailed information for all worktrees

**Note**: The Worktree tab is non-closeable, ensuring you can always access it.

### Creating a Worktree
1. Click the "Create Worktree" button in the toolbar
2. In the branch selection dialog:
   - Enter a branch name in the search box to filter
   - Select a branch from the list, or enter a new branch name
   - Double-click a list item or click OK to confirm
3. Enter the worktree directory path (or use the default path)
4. Confirm creation

### Opening a Worktree
- **Double-click** a table row to open the corresponding worktree directory in IDEA
- **Right-click** a row and select "Open Directory"

### Deleting a Worktree
- **Method 1**: Select a table row and click the "Delete Worktree" button in the toolbar

  - Confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions
  - Real-time search filtering
- **Git Integration**: Uses Git4Idea plugin API

## FAQ

### Q: How do I view plugin logs?
A: In IDEA, open Help → Show Log in Explorer and check the idea.log file.

### Q: Why can't I see the Worktree tab?
A: Ensure your project is a Git repository and the Git plugin is enabled.

### Q: Are files deleted when I remove a worktree?
A: `git worktree remove` removes the Git association of the worktree. Whether files are deleted depends on Git's behavior. It's recommended to backup important data before deletion.

### Q: Can I create worktrees based on remote branches?
A: Yes, enter the full remote branch name in the branch selection dialog (e.g., `origin/feature-branch`).
